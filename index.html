  <h1>Would you survive evolution?</h1>

  <p>The game I want to make would be based on adaptionism. Adaptionism believes in the importance of natural selection in nature. This idea presents it as the most important way to advancing biologically. In this manner only the best traits move forward and continue to evolve.</p>
  
  <P>
    The game I want to make would take this to heart. What I want to do is a game with multiple levels that force the player to "adapt" to the currnt situation. Each level will present a different way of playing the game (keyboard, mouse/mousepad, touchscreen?), as the rules of the game also change with regards to the new controls. Through the process of trial and error, the player will learn the most desirable traits or "moves," and as such adapt to the current situation. still haven't figured out how hard this is to make, so I might not stick with it to the end, or I might modify it.  
  </P>

    So far what I have is this: In the first stage the player will control our pixelated hero through the trackpad, and will have to dodge deadly arrows. After "x" number of arrows, the pixelated hero will manage to snatch one of them for himself, leading to the second stage: Rocks will cascade from the top of the canvas towardw the hero and, now using the keyboard, the player has to shoot the rocks and destroy them with the arrow he aquired. Maybe I could also keep making the technology more advanced.
